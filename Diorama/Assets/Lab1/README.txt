Description: 
My scene mimics an iconic moment in the video "Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess". The scene is of the Master Sword being put back at the alter in the ruins of Sacred Grove. I wanted to create the diorama in a simplitic style with minimal elements but enhance the existing elements/assets with lighting and textures.  

Elements of Scene:
 - Background of Sacred Grove Forest and alter applied as a texture to a plane.
 - Rocky/stone material applied to ground plane to simulate ruin environment.
 - Ruins asset placed on the ground and angled to create similar design from the game.
 - A sword asset used to represent the Master Sword placed in front of the alter from the background stabbed into the ground.
 - A directional light with a warmer light gradient to create sunlight. 
 - A spot light used above the Master Sword with cooler green/blue tint for an halo/aura effect around the sword. 
 - The main camera initially oreinted at the scene from a high angle.

Controls/Scripts: 

Main Camera: 
T = translation mode for main camera (default mode)
R = rotation mode for main camera

W = move camera forward / rotate about x-axis clockwise 
S = move camera backward / rotate about x-axis counter-clockwise 
A = move camera left / rotate about y-axis counter-clockwise 
D = move camera right / rotate about y-axis clockwise 
Q = move camera down / rotate about z-axis counter-clockwise
E = move camera up / rotate about z-axis clockwise 

Directional Light:
1 = increase brightness intensity 
2 = decrease brightness intensity 

G = move camera forward / rotate about x-axis clockwise 
B = move camera backward / rotate about x-axis counter-clockwise 
V = move camera left / rotate about y-axis clockwise 
N = move camera right / rotate about y-axis counter-clockwise 
F = move camera down / rotate about z-axis clockwise
H = move camera up / rotate about z-axis counter-clockwise 

Spot Light:
3 = increase brightness intensity 
4 = decrease brightness intensity 

I = move camera forward / rotate about x-axis counter-clockwise 
K = move camera backward / rotate about x-axis clockwise 
J = move camera left / rotate about y-axis counter-clockwise 
L = move camera right / rotate about y-axis clockwise 
U = move camera down / rotate about z-axis counter-clockwise
O = move camera up / rotate about z-axis clockwise 

Object Selection:
Z = switch between game objects (ruins, ground, sword, background, spot light) indicated via new material highlight/texture 
X = delete/remove game object 
C = clone game object somewhere random in scene
